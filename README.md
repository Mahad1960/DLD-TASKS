# Digital Logic Design (DLD) â€“ University Assignments:

This repository contains various tasks, lab work, and mini-projects completed as part of my **Digital Logic Design (DLD)** course at university. These tasks cover the foundational concepts of logic design, including combinational and sequential circuits, Boolean algebra, truth tables, Karnaugh maps, and circuit simulations.

Purpose:

The objective of this repository is to document my progress and understanding of DLD through assignments and practical simulations using tools like **Logisim**, **Multisim**, and **manual circuit design**.

Topics Covered:

Some of the core topics and assignments included:

- Number Systems & Conversions (Binary, Octal, Decimal, Hex)
- Boolean Algebra & Logic Gates
- Truth Tables & Logic Expressions
- Karnaugh Maps (K-Map Simplification)
- Combinational Circuits
  - Half Adder, Full Adder
  - Multiplexers (MUX), Demultiplexers (DEMUX)
  - Encoders, Decoders
  - Comparators
- Sequential Circuits
  - Flip-Flops (SR, D, T, JK)
  - Counters (Synchronous & Asynchronous)
  - Registers
- Timing Diagrams and Circuit Analysis
- Circuit Design using Logisim and Simulation Tools
